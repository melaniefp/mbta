# MBTA Programming Exercise

### This repo contains a programming exercise to handle MBTA data.

* relevant source code: ./src/

* buildable and executable program: python run.py

* Instructions can be found in ./docs

* Re testing: each file has been tested independently in their corresponding main.
    For proper code maintenance, separate unit tests need to be written separately; tests should return deterministic boolean outcomes (TODO)

Note for Question 1:

It is better to download it only once, to alleviate load to the server.
The size of the subway network is expected to be small, so it won't be a problem to store in memory.
